# KAG
a professional domain knowledge service framework: Knowledge Augmented Generation (KAG) to improve generation and reasoning performance by bidirectionally enhancing large language model(LLM)s and knowledge graph(KG)s, including five key enhancements: 
1) LLM-friendly knowledge semantic representation.
2) Mutual-indexing between knowledge graph and original chunks.
3) Knowledge alignment based on semantic reasoning to improve the information completeness and knowledge accuracy in the knowledge construction stage.
4) Logical-form-guided hybrid reasoning and solving to build automatic problem decomposition and symbol guided reasoning capabilities without extra prompting to improve the logical rigor of reasoning.
5) Model for KAG to reduce the economic cost and time consumption of KAG construction and reasoning.
